## Introduction
My objective for this project is to create a customized honeynet on Microsoft Azure. The honeynet will be strategically designed to entice attackers, allowing for comprehensive logging and monitoring of malicious traffic. Additionally, I will implement incident response protocols and robust hardening measures to ensure the utmost security of the environment."

## Objective  
"After creating Windows and Linux virtual machines, I intentionally configured the firewall and network gateway settings to allow unrestricted traffic from all ports. Furthermore, I disabled all features in Microsoft Defender Firewall. As a result, I have intentionally created a vulnerable internet-facing environment designed to attract potential attackers
