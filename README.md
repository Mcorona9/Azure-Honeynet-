## Introduction
My objective for this project is to create a customized honeynet on Microsoft Azure. The honeynet will be strategically designed to entice attackers, allowing for comprehensive logging and monitoring of malicious traffic. Additionally, I will implement incident response protocols and robust hardening measures to ensure the utmost security of the environment."
